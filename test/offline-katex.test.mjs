// Tests for offline KaTeX: the shipped distribution and the launcher that inlines it.
//
// Why this exists: the reader used to reach jsDelivr for every page, so a reading page opened
// through `file:///` pulled katex.min.js from the network on each load. Offline (or behind a
// proxy that eats the request) the formulas silently fell back to the plain-text renderer. The
// launcher now inlines a shipped copy instead.
//
// Two things can break that quietly, so both are asserted here:
//
//   1. The vendored dist must stay complete and self-consistent. `katex.min.css` declares
//      `@font-face` rules pointing at `fonts/…`; if the font files are pruned the page still
//      loads and still typesets, it just renders in the browser's fallback font. Nothing else
//      in the repo would notice.
//   2. The inlining must not corrupt the base reader, the document, or the reader's script.
//
// `open-md.ps1` cannot run under Node, so the tests assert the script's shape and the
// invariants of the snippets it assembles. That is the part a regression would break.
//
// Run:  node --test
